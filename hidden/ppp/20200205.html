		<h2>premise
			<h3>The video is loosely about a trans woman looking back at her younger self, but without forming a concrete narrative.<br>It is intended to be universally recognizable to trans people without becoming rote or generic, and still putting forth a deliberate sense of style and aesthetic. </h3>
		<br><br><br>

		<h3>
			INT BEDROOM - DAY <br>
			We whip-pan into the bedroom of THE KID (late-teens, dressed in boys clothes - we never clearly see their face). They lie in bed, sheets wet from tears. Tawny sunlight fills the space. There is a quiet stillness. <br>
			BRIE is suddenly standing there, ethereally watching over The Kid. She sits softly on the bed, and put a hand on their shoulder. <br>
			<br>
			We also get some shots of Brie, sitting alone in the room, singing.<br>
			<br>
		</h3>

		<h3>
			EXT ALLEYWAY - DUSK<br>
			We start cutting to the band walking confidently down the an alley, in slow motion, singing.<br>

		<h3>
			INT GRUNGY VENUE - NIGHT<br>
			We don't see much but darkness, party lights, and The Kid leaning timidly against the wall.<br>
			We see closeups of manic feet dancing on the concrete, sifting glitter every which way.<br>

		</h3>

		<h3>
			EXT ALLEYWAY â€“ NIGHT<br>
			In slow motion, The Kid walks down the road, passing in and out of streetlight beams. Hands in pockets, they look crumpled. <br>
			The whole band is suddenly a few meters behind them, all confidently walking in slow motion.<br>
 		  They walk together a while. Suddenly, The Kid stops and turns around, facing the band, making eye contact with Brie, The Kid starts walking towards her, then running. The band continues confidently walking.<br>
			The Kid rips past them and keeps running. Brie smiles.<br>
			Cut back to normal speed, The Kid barrels down the street, and eventually off into the dark, as the song ends. <br>

		<h2>style</h2>
		<h3>
			There will be an inherent grittiness due the budget of the production, but we can embrace that for a sense of authenticity.<br>
			The video is a mix of slow, otherworldly moments (meant to contrast the song) and kinetic, energized beats (meant to emphasize it). It includes a mix of standard 24p footage, slomo 60p, and step-printed 12p. <br>
			(the video below is an example of slow motion singing (the people were originally walking normal speed) and 12p (the low framerate))<br>

		<h2>notes</h2>
		<p> I've written this with low resources in mind. It's generally seen as distastful to ask local crew to volunteer on music videos, so this would be more of a friends / family affair. Thankfully, I like small crews, and friends. I'd be taking care of directing, camera, and post.<br>
