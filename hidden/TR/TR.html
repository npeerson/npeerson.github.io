<h1>TRANSISTOR RIOT</h1>
<p>We shoot individual passes of each band member (and maybe some combinations) across a day or two (under sun, moon, and twilight), steadily circling them (like holding down a thumbstick). Under the precision of the move, we can transition between passes seamlessly, percieving the inprecise layers of reality with the unreal omniscience of cyberspace.
<br> 
<br>potential locations: the parking lot across from your place, the creative block venue.
<br>costs: film equipment: ~$100, additional equipment:~$50, location access:~$50</p>
